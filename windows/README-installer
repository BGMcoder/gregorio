This folder is dedicated to the windows self-installer.

The first step is to compile gregorio.exe. You can certainly do so under a
windows compiler, but it hasn't been tested. A more convenient way is to
compile it under Linux with mingw32 (aptitude install mingw32 under debian
systems). Compile it with `./build.sh --mingw' in the root directory. You
also need the .tds.zip archive. To compile it, execute make tds in the fonts
directory.

To build the installer, you must first have Windows and InnoSetup (free) 
installed. Then build a folder under windows witht the following files:
  |
  + gregorio.exe
  + gregorio.iss
  + gregorio.ico
  + gregorio-32.bmp
  + gregorio-image.bmp
  + license.txt
  + README.txt of this folder
  + install.lua
  + gregoriotex.tds.zip
  + contrib\
  + + all the files of the contrib/ directory of the svn
  + examples\
  + + all the files of the contrib/ directory of the svn

Then simply compile the gregorio.iss file with InnoSetup and you're done.

The installer works a quite complex (but necessary) way: it installs everything
somewhere the user wants (like C:\Program Files\Gregorio) and then executes
install.lua to install correctly everything under TeXLive (TEXMFLOCAL); 
finally it executes mktexlsr.exe with the correct options.

This folder is dedicated to the windows self-installer.

To build the installer, you must first have Windows and InnoSetup (free) 
installed. Then build a folder under windows witht the following files:
  |
  + gregorio.exe
  + gregorio.iss
  + license.txt
  + README.txt of this folder
  + install.lua
  + fonts\
  + + all the files of the fonts/ directory of the svn
  + tex\
  + + all the files of the tex/ directory of the svn
  + contrib\
  + + all the files of the contrib/ directory of the svn

Then simply compile the gregorio.iss file with InnoSetup and you're done.

The installer works a strange (but sadly necessary) way: it installs everything
somewhere the user wants (like C:\Program Files\Gregorio) and then executes
install.lua to install correctly everything under TeXLive (TEXMFLOCAL), and
finally it executes updmap-sys.exe and updmap.exe with the correct options.

\newcount\isonaline

% a very useful macro : it determines the good height of a glyph : the argument is the "number" where the glyph should be : 4 for the first line, 6 for the second, etc.
% the second argument is for the cases of signs: for example if the note is on a line, the punctummora will be above, and the auctus duplex beneath. the possible values are:
%% 0: no modification
%% 1: puts the value on the interline just above if it is on a line
%% 2: puts the value on the interline just beneath if it is on a line
%% 3: case of the vertical episemus, which is not placed at the same place if the corresponding note is on a line or not
%% 4: case of the punctum mora, for the same reason

The same limitation applies for the syllable after the bar.

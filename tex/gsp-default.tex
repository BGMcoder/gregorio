% this file contains definitions of spaces and penalties

%% First, the penalties

% penalty at the end of a syllable which is the end of a word
\xdef\greendofwordpenalty{-100}
% penalty at the end of a syllable which is not the end of a word
\xdef\greendofsyllablepenalty{-50}
% penalty at the end of a syllable which is just a bar, with something printed
% under it
\xdef\greendafterbarpenalty{-200}
% penalty right after a bar with nothing printed
\xdef\greendafterbaraltpenalty{-200}
% penalty at the end of a breakable neumatic element (typically at a space
% between elements)
\xdef\greendofelementpenalty{-50}
% hyphenpenalty will be used in discretionaries, in Gregorio this is used for
% a bar with clef change for example. It also set \exhyphenpenalty. It should
% be close to \greendafterbarpenalty
\xdef\grehyphenpenalty{-200}

% broken penalty is the vertical penalty inserted after a break on a clef change
% I'm not sure it should be set, but it might be useful...

% By default, we don't care if a line of score is alone on the page,
% if you think it is bad, you can modify the two following values. Assigning
% 10000 to them will prevent all orphaned lines (this will certainly improve
% some spacings a lot).
\def\grewidowpenalty{0}
\def\greclubpenalty{0}

%% And finally, all the spacings:

%% All the following values correspond to a grefactor of 1,
%% so in most cases it will be much smaller that what you will finally
%% get with an average factor (17 is the default value for the factor).
%% We multiply all the columns by the factor when the factor changes,
%% and it changes at the beginning of the first score by default.

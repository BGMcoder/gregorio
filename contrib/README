Here is the description of the different files in this section.

Scribus: gregorio-scribus.lua, gregorio.png and 900_gregorio.xml
========
These are files to use Gregorio in scribus. To use them, copy the three files
in the editorconfig folder of scribus (/usr/share/scribus/editorconfig
under debian for example, or C:\Program Files\Scribus\share\editorconfig
under Windows). Then read the comments in the .xml files and change some
variables accordingly. 
The second step is to allow Scribus to call gregorio: go in 
File->Preferences->External Tools, click add in the "Render Frames" part and
select the file 900_gregorio.xml.
After that you can insert a render frame using the program gregorio, and simply 
typing gabc (in right-click->edit sources).

Gnome/Gtk/Gedit: gabc.lang
================
This is a lang file for gabc syntax highlighting in all the text viewer of
the gnome project, like gedit. Simply copy the file in 
/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ and it will work. There are still
some bugs to fix, but at least it looks better.

Kde/Kate/Kedit: gabc.xml
===============
This is a file for syntax highlighting in kate (and Kedit, etc.). To 
install it, simply copy the file in /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax. This path
may not be the same according to your distribution.

Vim: gabc.vim
====
This is the highlight syntax file for vim. You can copy it in
/usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/syntax (on debian at least) and add the line
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.gabc                    setf gabc
somewhere near lines of the same type (near line 100 for example) in
/usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/filetype.vim . This will autodetect the filetypes.

TeXShop (Mac OSX): gregorio.engine and gregorio.scpt
=================
There are 2 ways of compiling gabc files directly from TeXShop:
1) Using gregorio.engine. To do this, copy gregorio.engine into ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines.
Then in a Terminal window, run 
defaults write TeXShop OtherTeXExtensions -array-add "gabc"
Restart TeXShop, and you should be able to see "gregorio" as a typesetting 
option in the upper left corner.
2) Using gregorio.scpt. It will call gregorio on your gabc file, converting 
to gtex. You can modify it if you need another output format. To set it up, 
open the Macro Editor in TeXShop. Select New Item,
and call it gregorio (or whatever you wish). Copy and paste all the text of 
gregorio.scpt into the Content window, and click save. To use it, type and 
save a gabc file and then just choose the gregorio macro from the menu.

BBEdit and TextWrangler: gabc-syntax.plist
========================
This file will highlight gabc syntax in the BBEdit and TextWrangler editors. To
install it, just copy it into ~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/ 
and restart BBEdit or TextWrangler.

Automatic Gregorio Processing: gprocess
==============================
gprocess is a perl script to instantly compile and show the result of a gabc
file. You can modify some variables directly into the script, for example the
pdf viewer program.

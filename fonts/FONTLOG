FONTLOG for Gregorio
====================

This file provides detailed information on the Gregorio font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Gregorio fonts and 
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
======================

The Gregorio project aims at providing fonts for gregorian chant, and a TeX
file to use them easilly. Many fonts can be used and adapted to it.

For now the only font distributed with Gregorio is a font named gregorio. It
has been made by Elie Roux in 2007. See the README file if you want to
contribute and build you own font. If you made a gregorian chant font (in
square or ancient notation) under a free (GPL or OFL) license, mail
gregorio-devel@gna.org, we will be happy to integrate it in the project!

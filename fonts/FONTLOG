FONTLOG for Gregorio
====================

This file provides detailed information on the Gregorio font software. 
This information should be distributed along with the Gregorio fonts and 
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
======================

The Gregorio project aims at providing fonts for gregorian chant, and a TeX
file to use them easilly. Many fonts can be used and adapted to it.

See the README file if you want to contribute and build you own font. If you
made a gregorian chant font (in square or ancient notation) under a free (GPL
or OFL) license, mail gregorio-devel@gna.org, we will be happy to integrate it
in the project!

The project has two fonts: 

- gregorio, created by Elie Roux with fontforge in 2007

- parmesan, created by Juergen Reuter in 2000 in metafont, and
  adapted to gregorio by Elie Roux in 2007

- greciliae, created by Matthew Spencer in 2007 in otf, and
  adapted to gregorio by Elie Roux in 2008

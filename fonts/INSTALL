Font generation
================
Gregorio works with LuaTeX, which enables the use of truetype files (.ttf). The chant font files you'll need to install in your TeX system are now included with Gregorio, so for most people there is no need to regenerate the font files. For those interested in modifying the included chant fonts, or even developing their own, these instructions on how to generate the fonts may be helpful.

You can notice if you open gregorio-base.sfd (sfd is the native fontforge format), that there are only a few glyphs. First you must combine them to get all the glyphs (more than 1000). It is made by a quite dirty trick: a python script (squarize.py) generates a fontforge script (fontname.pe) that generates nine 255 character fonts containing all the glyphs of gregorian chant. It generates the fonts in pfb, afm, enc and tfm.

In the next steps, we create gregorio, but to create parmesan or greciliae, just replace "gregorio" by "parmesan" or "greciliae".

So for now the basic use is:

 python squarize.py gregorio

It may require around one minute.

gresym and greextra contain additional glyphs which are not part of the square notation, but which often appear in Gregorian chant scores.  Since there are so few glyphs in these fonts, they are simply converted to a ttf font with convertsfdtottf.py.  Usage for this script is:

 python convertsfdtottf.py gresym.sfd


Note: Both squarize.py and convertsfdtottf run on Python 2.7.  If that is not your default python installation, then replace "python" with the appropriate call to python 2.7 on your system (usually python2.7).

Additionally, both scripts are executable on their own, so long as you have a "python2" pointer in your PATH which points to python 2.7.


Font and TeX installation
=========================
To install the fonts, running

 make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf

will install both font and TeX files. Warning: 'make install' without giving a TEXMFROOT will put files in TEXMFHOME, which might not be what you want. TEXMFHOME is typically $HOME/texmf/ under Debian or Ubuntu.

Note: If you want make to recreate the fonts you need to have a "python2" pointer in your PATH which points to python 2.7.

You may also need to execute this command as a superuser (i.e. with sudo), especially on a Mac.

You can also copy the fonts in

C:\Windows\Fonts under Windows or

/usr/share/fonts/truetype under Linux.

They also work when in the current directory.

Once you have everything installed, run

mktexlsr

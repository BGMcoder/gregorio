Font generation
================
Gregorio works with LuaTeX, which enables the use of truetype files (.ttf). The chant font files you'll need to install in your TeX system are now included with Gregorio, so for most people there is no need to regenerate the font files. For those interested in modifying the included chant fonts, or even developing their own, these instructions on how to generate the fonts may be helpful.

You can notice if you open gregorio-base.sfd (sfd is the native fontforge format), that there are only a few glyphs. First you must combine them to get all the glyphs (more than 1000). It is made by a quite dirty trick: a python script (squarize.py) generates a fontforge script (fontname.pe) that generates nine 255 character fonts containing all the glyphs of gregorian chant. It generates the fonts in pfb, afm, enc and tfm.

In the next steps, we create gregorio, but to create parmesan or greciliae, just replace "gregorio" by "parmesan" or "greciliae".

So for now the basic use is:

 python squarize.py gregorio

It may require around one minute.

Font and TeX installation
=========================
To install the fonts, running

make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf

will install both font and TeX files. Warning: 'make install' without giving a TEXMFROOT will put files in TEXMFHOME, which might not be what you want. TEXMFHOME is typically $HOME/texmf/ under Debian or Ubuntu.

You can also copy the fonts in

C:\Windows\Fonts under Windows or

/usr/share/fonts/truetype under Linux.

They also work when in the current directory.

Once you have everything installed, run

mktexlsr

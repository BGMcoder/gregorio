WHAT IS GREGORIO?

Gregorio is a project which goal is to provide tools for gregorian
chant composition. The tools are for example:

 * GregorioXML: a XML representation of gregorian chant
 * GregorioTeX: a TeX (Omega) style for typesetting gregorian chant
scores
 * The gregorio software, a command-line interface to convert
different types of files into others (convert a gabc file into
GregorioTeX or OpusTeX for example)

INSTALLATION of the gregorio software:

First, before compiling gregorio, you need a recent fontforge version 
(after 20070501), because fontforge changed their format after this release
and the .sfd file is in this new format. Please visit
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&package_id=114328
to download a recent fontforge version.

gregorio depends on the libxml2, you must have it installed. If you
want to compile from the sources, you must have the header files of
the libxml2 and flex and bison (of course you will need gcc and make
too).

gregorio also uses perl, python, ovp2ovf and tf2pl, be sure to have all
these programs installed.

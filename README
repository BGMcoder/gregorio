    Gregorio release 0.2 <http://home.gna.org/gregorio>

These are the release notes for Gregorio version 0.2.

WHAT IS GREGORIO?

Gregorio is a project which goal is to provide tools for gregorian
chant composition. The tools are for example:

 * GABC: a fast notation for representing gregorian chant
 * GregorioXML: a XML representation of gregorian chant
 * GregorioTeX: a TeX (Omega) style for typesetting gregorian chant
scores
 * The gregorio software, a command-line interface to convert
different types of files into others (convert a gabc file into
GregorioTeX or OpusTeX for example)

INSTALLATION of the gregorio software:

First, before compiling gregorio, you need a recent fontforge version 
(after 20070501), because fontforge changed their format after this release
and the .sfd file is in this new format. Please visit
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&package_id=114328
to download a recent fontforge version.

gregorio depends on the libxml2, you must have it installed. If you
want to compile from the sources, you must have the header files of
the libxml2 and flex and bison (of course you will need gcc and make
too).

gregorio also uses perl, python, ovp2ovf and tf2pl, be sure to have all
these programs installed.

If you downloaded the tarball from
<http://download.gna.org/gregorio/releases/>, simply do

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

If you downloaded the sources from the svn repository
(<svn://svn.gna.org/svn/gregorio/trunk>), you must before run

 $ autoreconf --install -f

For all the details about the options of autotools, read the file named
INSTALL.

There are some facilities in GregorioTeX to call gregorio directly from 
TeX. To use them you have two solutions: you can call your TeX compiler
(aleph or lualatex typically) with the option --shell-escape, or, if you
have TeXLive 2009 (or later) installed, you can add gregorio to the list
of the programs allowed to execute from TeX. This list is in the file
texmf.cnf (typically C:\Program Files\texlive\2009\texmf\web2c\texmf.cnf
under windows and /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf under Linux), at the line starting
by 'shell_escape_commands = ', you simply have to add gregorio to this
list of commands.

USING the gregorio software:

gregorio can handle several file types. To use the software for
converting a gabc file into a GregorioTeX file, simply do

 $ gregorio myfile.gabc

To see all the possible gregorio options, try

 $ gregorio -h

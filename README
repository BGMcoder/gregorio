Gregorio is a project which goal is to provide tools for gregorian score
engraving. The tools are for example:

* GABC: a fast notation for representing gregorian chant
* GregorioXML: a XML representation of gregorian chant
* GregorioTeX: a LuaTeX style for typesetting gregorian chant scores
* The gregorio software, a command-line interface to convert
different types of files into others (convert a gabc file into
GregorioTeX or OpusTeX for example)
